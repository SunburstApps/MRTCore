# MRTCore

This repository contains a copy of [MRT Core](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion/tree/main/dev/MRTCore),
packaged so it can be used separately from WinUI 3. It also includes a set of MSBuild targets that create a self-contained
PRI file from the contents of a given folder, for use with MRT Core.
